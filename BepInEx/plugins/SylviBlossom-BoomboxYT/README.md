# Boombox YouTube
A simple mod to play YouTube links on the Boombox.

## Usage
Press `Q` to import a YouTube link from your clipboard, and press `E` to clear the imported song and return to normal Boombox music. While custom music is playing, use `+` and `-` (rebindable) to change its volume.

When importing music for all players is finished, it will inform you in the chat, and you can play your song. During one play session, importing the same YouTube link again will load it immediately without re-downloading, and retain its volume settings.

**This mod might not be compatible with other boombox mods!!** It was made as a quick thing just for me and my friends.
